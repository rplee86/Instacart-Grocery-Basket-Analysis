## Python Data Analytics Project
In this data analytics project, I use open source data from Instacart, as well as data fabricated by [CareerFoundry](https://careerfoundry.com/) in service of applying my data analystics skills learned from their course, to uncover information about Instacart sales patterns and create customer profiles. This repository contains the following:
- 01 Project Management folder: Contains the project brief, fabricated for the purpose of learning.
- 02 Data: Contains the customers.csv data set fabricated by CareerFoundry.
- 03 Scripts: Contains all python scripts used to clean and analyze the data.
- 04 Analysis: Contains all of the data visualizations.
- 05 Sent to client: Contains a report of the findings.
